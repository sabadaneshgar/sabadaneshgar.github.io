Hello! <br>
I am a researcher at BIOMATH, Ghent University.<br>
My research focus is on mathematical modelling and optimization of bio-processes. I am particularly interested in developing mechanistic models for a wide range of applications from water and wastewater treatment processes to biopharmaceutical processes.  </span>
