My name is Saba Daneshgar. I am a postdoctoral researcher at BIOMATH,
Department of Data Analysis and Mathematical Modelling, Ghent University
focusing on model-based optimization of bio-processes, digital twin
development, hybrid modelling and model-based control.
I studied chemical engineering in my home country, Iran at Iran
University of Science and Technology (IUST) with a focus on
mathematical modelling and simulation of chemical processes.
Then, I shifted my focus to environmental engineering and
wastewater treatment processes during my master studies at
Politecnico di Milano in Italy. I got my PhD from University of
Pavia in Italy in 2019 where I focused my research on
development, modelling and optimization of phosphorus
recovery process from aerobic wastewater streams.
