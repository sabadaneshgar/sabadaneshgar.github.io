# Model-based optimization of bioprocesses
A big part of my research is focused on developing mechanistic
models for (bio)processes. This mainly involves (bio)kinetic
modelling where (bio)chemical reactions are described using
differential equations. Model calibration/validation, sensitivity
analysis and scenario analysis are key aspects of this research
line. A famous example here is the Activated Sludge Models
(ASM) for describing biological wastewater treatment
processes.
